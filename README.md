This repository contains summaries and links to my current web development projects.

## Details

This project was built with React components in VSCode using HTML, SCSS/CSS, vanilla JavaScript and JSX. Additional packages used include React Router Dom, React Media, and React Scroll. Wireframes and mock-ups for the design were originally sketched using InVision Studio. The images are licensed from Envato Elements and edited using Affinity Designer, and the icons are free use from Font Awesome.
